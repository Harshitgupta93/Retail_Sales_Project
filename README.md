# Retail_Sales_Project
1. In this project, I utilized PySpark on Databricks, leveraging Windows functions, GroupBy, Aggregation, PartitionBy, 
and OrderBy to analyze and process sales data effectively.  
2. Databricks automatically handles the creation of the SparkSession, so you may not need to create one explicitly.
